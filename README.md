# alt-bespoke-docs

alternative documentation for [Bespoke synth](https://github.com/BespokeSynth/BespokeSynthh). Offical docs are [here](https://www.bespokesynth.com/docs/). 

We have these chapters now:

- [Terminology](terminology.md) documents unusual terminology (and answers *Where do I find XY?*)

We definitely want these chapters:

- FAQ
- How to do XY?

**Feel free to contribute!**

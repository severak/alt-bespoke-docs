# Basic usage AKA How do I do XY?

Please see [Basic Usage Walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYBc8X2IxqM) before looking into this document. This video show basic usage of Bespoke synth better that me trying to decribe it in words.

There are usually multiple ways to achieve same result. 

Some of the actions rely on using keyboard, there is no menu item for every action.

## adding new module

- choose from main menu
- hold first letter of module name (e.g. o for `oscillator`) and then choose from the menu
- if you cannot find desired module, see chapter [terminology](terminology.md) to find out what you really need
	
## copy module

- hold alt and drag module by it's title bar

## deactivating and activating module

- click dot before module name in title bar

## deleting module

- lasso select modules you want to delete and then press backspace
- use triangle menu in module title bar and *delete module* button

## patching cables

- drag from dot at the bottom of source module to destination module
- click the dot at the bottom of source module and then dot in title bar of destination module
- note that you can only connect which have right type of signal (e.g. cannot connect `notesequencer` output to `gain`)

## splitting cables

- hold shift and drag from where you want to split cable
- if you are splitting audio cable, `send` module is created

## deleting cables

- drag cable from either end and hit backspace

## inserting module into cable path

- hold shift and then drag bottom dot of module to target

## set precise value for slider

- hover the mouse over slider, enter the desired value using number keys and hit enter

## set precise values for envelope

- press F2 to switch envelope from graphics view to sliders view

## create LFO on slider

- right click slider and LFO popup appears

## turn LFO into regular module

- click *pin* in LFO popup

## manage VST plugins

- set your `vstsearchdir` (in config) to directory where you have limited amout of VSTs which you want to use with Bespoke

or (on Windows)

use [BespokePluginScanner](https://www.bespokesynth.com/builds/BespokePluginScanner.exe):

> this is a separate app (an example juce app that I ripped pieces out of) that can scan for VSTs better than bespoke can, and then export the scanned list into bespoke 
> to use it:
> 
> - close bespoke
> - run this app
> - go to Options->Edit the List of Available Plug-ins...
> - click the Options... button below to initiate the scans
> - edit the list to however you would like it (you can remove plugins you don't care about, for example)
> - close that window, then in the main window, go to Options->Export plugins list to Bespoke
> - now open bespoke, and you should (hopefully) be all set, with all scanned VSTs accessible! 
if this band-aid works, then I will integrate a nicer version of this process into bespoke 1.0.1

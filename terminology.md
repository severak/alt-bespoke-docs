# terminology

Bespoke synth sometimes uses different terminology than other DAWs or it uses familiar words in unusual way.

There you can find where to look when you are looking for something:

- **control voltage** - pulse
- **filter** - *biquad* or *butterworth* in *effectchain*, but most complex synths has filter already built-in
- **oscillator** - Bespoke oscillator is in fact full featured synth, use *signalgenerator* if you want low level oscillator
- **reverb** - look for *freeverb* in *effectchain*
- **sequencer** - look to *instruments* menu
- **transpose** - use *capo* for transposing notes by semitones, *noteoctaver* for transposing by octave and *transposefrom* for transposing according to scale
